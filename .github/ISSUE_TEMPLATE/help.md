about: Ask for help on a problem
---
Issues should primarily be used for bug reports and feature requests.

Before you ask for help on a problem, please answer the following questions:

- Am I asking for help on a simple problem that is unreleated to or outside the scope of this project? (yes/no)
- Can I ask for help on StackOverflow instead of GitHub? (yes/no)

If you answered "yes" to one of those questions, please do not create an issue asking for help.
